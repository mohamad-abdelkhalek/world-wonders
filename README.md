# World Wonders

This project displays a list of the world's wonders using an API to fetch data. The website allows users to view all wonders in a list format, with each wonder linking to a details page. The project is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and utilizes an API to fetch the data.

## Features
- Displays all world wonders fetched from an external API.
- Each wonder is displayed in a card with an image and name.
- A "View Details" link for each wonder redirects to a detailed page (`wonder.html`) with more information.
- Wonders data is stored in the browserâ€™s `localStorage` for persistent access without needing to re-fetch the data.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Basic structure and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the website.
